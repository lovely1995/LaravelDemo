	<h3 align="center">After a few days, with my Hazelnut one of the last still lost, I began to lose hope. Perhaps he had been hit by a car, or suffered such serious glass cuts that he had died, alone and afraid, on the street</h3>
	<br>
	<p>
	Several days later I was working on a story, writing about sniffer dogs searching for survivors in the rubble. Filming them had brought me to tears as I struggled to put Bunduq out of my mind. Suddenly, a message popped up on my phone. "Did you lose a dog?"
	Thinking it was one of the dozens of people who'd contacted me asking for more pictures to help the search, I said yes.

	"I think I have him," the messager said.
	"Where?"
	"In Tripoli."
	It didn't seem possible. Tripoli, Lebanon's second largest city, was 80km (50 miles) away.
	"That couldn't be him," I responded. "We live in Beirut."
	A video popped up, downloading painfully slowly on the devastated city's patchy internet. And there he was. Scared, a little bloodied, but alive.
